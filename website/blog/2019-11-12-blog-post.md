This is the obligatory first blog post.  

I started doing this to learn markdown, docusaurus, github pages and git in general.  At work I am more involved in creating the documentation than I am in managing where the documentation is stored.  As we 'shift left' everyone will have to know how to do everything and this is my chance to learn on my own time.  But now, I think this may be a good way to share my trials and errors with learning and developing a 'DevOps' culture mindset.

My career arc has been varied, but interesting.  I started my career as a system tester and moved into java development.  After java development, I was able to move into middleware administration. Then from there, my role changed into a full stack engineer. Finally, it moved back into a developer but this time of infrastructure as code.  I am now using chef, ruby, and git (when I started my career I was using svn).  All of this has been a complete cultural shift, from "lock down everything everywhere", to "how do I enable you to do this for yourself while also being mindful of security".  I have had my doubts, and I have had moments of excitement that kept me moving forward.

I hope to setup a jenkins pipeline to be able to easily deploy new documentation and yes, future blog posts.

As always, this site remains under construction.
